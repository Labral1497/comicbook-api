Create a vibrant, ultra-high-resolution comic book cover. The artwork should be a masterpiece of digital illustration, suitable for a professional digital print.

**PRIMARY SUBJECT & SCENE (MANDATORY):**
* **Main Character Resemblance:** The central figure must be illustrated to closely resemble the person in the provided image. **Focus specifically on these unique facial features, hair, and head/face accessories:** hairstyle, hair color and patterns, eyebrow shape, eye area (without guessing eye color if hidden), facial hair style (if any), skin tone, and any notable accessories such as glasses, hats, piercings, or earrings visible in the image.
* **Scene Description:** The illustration must bring this scene to life: **"{cover_art_description}"**. Capture the action, expression, and mood described in the scene, ensuring the main character is central to this scene and rendered with the specified resemblance.
{ref_block}

**ARTISTIC STYLE & EXECUTION (MANDATORY):**
* **Core Style:** Professional digital comic book art. Bold, clean line work with dynamic, cinematic lighting and shadows.
* **Theme Influence:** The visual style should be heavily influenced by the **"{user_theme}"** theme.
* **Color Palette:** Use a vibrant, saturated, and eye-catching color palette that makes the cover pop. Unless the theme requires otherwise.
* **Quality:** Render with hyper-detailed, sharp focus, epic quality (cover-grade).

**COMMERCIAL DETAILS (MANDATORY):**
* To make this look like an authentic comic book you would find in a store, you MUST include the following elements:
  1. **Barcode:** Place a realistic-looking UPC barcode in the bottom corner (e.g., bottom-left).
  2. **Humorous Sticker/Burst:** Add a fun, flashy sticker or starburst shape somewhere on the cover with a funny emblem (no real text).

**CRITICAL RULE:**
* **No real-world brands or text.** All branding and text on the commercial details (barcode, sticker, etc.) must be completely fictional. Use gibberish or non-sensical symbols instead of legible characters to avoid any trademark issues.
