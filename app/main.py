* **Core Style:** Professional digital comic book art. Bold, clean line work with dynamic, cinematic lighting and shadows.
* **Theme Influence:** The visual style should be heavily influenced by the **"{user_theme}"** theme.
* **Color Palette:** Use a vibrant, saturated, and eye-catching color palette that makes the cover pop. Unless the theme requires otherwise.
* **Quality:** Render with hyper-detailed, sharp focus, epic quality (cover-grade).

**COMMERCIAL DETAILS (MANDATORY):**
* To make this look like an authentic comic book you would find in a store, you MUST include the following elements:
  1. **Barcode:** Place a realistic-looking UPC barcode in the bottom corner (e.g., bottom-left).

* **No real-world brands or text.** All branding and text on the commercial details (barcode, sticker, etc.) must be completely fictional. Use gibberish or non-sensical symbols instead of legible characters to avoid any trademark issues.
